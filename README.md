Predictive models in Python for Explainable AI


Notebook contains to 3 different models:<br />
2 models are constructed : `Random Forest Classifier` and `XGBClassifier`. 
* [Nhanes without Multivariates](Nhanes3.ipynb) - In this the feature space is reduced by removing variables which can be explained by other independent variable.
* [Nhanes without removing Multivariates](Nhanes3-All%20Features.ipynb) - In this all of the features are used without treating for multivariates.
* [Nhanes Healthy patients](Nhanes3-Healthy.iypnb) - In this all Patients with Mi, HF and Stroke are removed, for emphasis on metabolic sydrome. 
* [Nhanes Deep Learning Healthy patients](Nhanes3-DeepLearning.ipynb) - In this all Patients with Mi, HF and Stroke are removed, for emphasis on metabolic sydrome, using Deep Learning.
